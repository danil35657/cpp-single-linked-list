# cpp-single-linked-list

## Description

A single linked list is an analog of std::forward_list, provides insertion and deletion of elements in an arbitrary position of the list in constant time, counting the number of elements, checking for emptiness, etc.

## Instructions for use

Download the archive with the project to the local directory of your PC. It is necessary to have a C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.) or an IDE with C++ support.  We recommend using the latest versions of compilers or IDE. 

To compile a project and build an executable file (using the GCC compiler as an example), run on the command line:
```
g++ *.cpp â€“o list
```
Next, run the executable file "list" on the command line.

An example of using a single-linked-list (adding and removing elements, accessing elements, etc.) is contained in the "main" file. If necessary, delete the lines with examples or comment out.
